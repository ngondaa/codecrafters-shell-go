This is a starting point for Go solutions to the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

building own POSIX compliant shell that's capable of
interpreting shell commands, running external programs and builtin commands like
cd, pwd, echo and more. 

# Note:
1. Ensure you have `go (1.25)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `app/main.go`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
